# Temporary Relief

From Monday, October 29th, to Friday, November 2nd, I tracked how many times I cracked my neck, back, wrists, fingers, and toes. Inspired by Week Seven in Dear Data, I decided that I wanted to compose a piece of music for my data visualization. Therefore, I averaged out the number of times I cracked each specific part of my body across these five days. Here's what I found:

+ 25 neck cracks
+ 9 back cracks
+ 4 wrist cracks
+ 106 finger cracks
+ 41 toe cracks

Using these numbers, I realized that in a typical day, I'd crack these parts around this many times. Before actually composing my musical piece, I created a key. First, I knew that I wanted my piece to sound as if the cracks were moving from the top of the body to the bottom of the body. Therefore, I decided on neck cracks being the highest note you hear in the piece (because it is at the top of the body), and toe cracks to be the lowest note (because toes are at the bottom of the body). Next, I assigned each body part with a specific note. Deciding to compose my piece in C major, I based my note decisions on the C major arpeggio. Therefore, my toes would be the note E; my fingers would be the note G; my wrists would be the note C; my back would be the note E; and my neck would be a high G. 

Next was time to decide which type of notes each body part would represent. I ultimately decided to match the quickeness of the crack/the time betweeen each crack to the note length. Therefore, I assigned as follows:

+ Neck - quarter note
+ Back - half note
+ Wrist - whole note
+ Fingers - sixteenth notes
+ Toes - half notes

After my planning was officially over, I created a [sample staff to act as the key](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1InAIr-EG90noLZE31z7sWMlVH0iBswvy/view?usp=sharing). This staff showed where each note would be (the pitch), what it would look like (type of note), and which body part it represented. 


AND FINALLY, THE MOMENT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR...HERE IS THE [COMPOSITION](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hlwmfMOICkU3W-8PgRJ8a6P-FhlRQss9/view?usp=sharing)! If you'd prefer to take a listen, click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kcGKIckk8mdagl-QljhMgyV--9GTH6wX/view?usp=sharing).

*Please note that the notes played should instead have a short, sharply detached sound (to mimic the popping sound) as opposed to the long notes heard in the audio clip*
