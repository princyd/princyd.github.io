# Distracted Driving Family Plan
### by Princess Dyer

   Distracted driving is an issue that plagues everyone living in a society in which automobiles, or even scooters, are present. Distracted driving not only puts the person driving in danger, but also those in the automobile, on the road, and family members of those involved. Each family should have a distracted driving plan, even if someone doesn’t drive.

   Many do not realize that you can still put many lives in danger when operating a vehicle but not using a handheld device. One could be identified as distracted by eating, drinking, smoking, performing a concert along with the radio, using a phone, and more [(Distracted Driving Accidents, p. 3)](https://ankinlaw.com/dangers-of-distracted-driving/ 
). According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there exists three types of distracted driving: visual, manual, and cognitive [(Policy Statement, p. 1)](http://www.nhtsa.gov.edgesuite-staging.net/Driving+Safety/Distracted+Driving/Policy+Statement+and+Compiled+FAQs+on+Distracted+Driving
).

   In order to combat the distracted driving phenomena, my family and I have created a Distracted Driving Family Plan which targets the three types of distracted driving. Visual distraction includes taking your eyes off of the road while operating a vehicle. In order to ensure that we do not become visually impaired while driving, we make sure to check our phones before driving, to put our phones out of sight (i.e. in our closed purse), and make sure everything is where it needs to be. For example, if there’s a bag sitting on one of my seats and I make a sharp turn, it may cause the contents in the bag to fall out. This raises an issue as I would take a second to register what the noise was that I heard, which may tempt me to reach for the contents that spilled out of the bag. In ensuring that bags are in my trunk, fastened in the seatbelt, or already on the ground securely, it makes it so I am less likely to take my eyes off of the road. In addition to this, we always take time to adjust our mirrors before driving so that we do not have to focus on this while driving.

   Manual distraction is when you take your hands off of the wheel. My family’s plan of making sure things are secure and that our phone is away before driving also helps to combat manual distraction. If there’s nothing in our line of sight that we could reach for and grab, then our hands will stay on the wheel. However, in addition to the protocols seen above, we make sure to adjust the air temperature in the car and find a radio station and volume that suits us before driving. This way, we don’t have to change anything while on the road. However, if necessary, we make sure that we wait until we are at a red light to turn knobs, or we ask someone sitting in the passenger seat to do it for us. As my family takes many road trips, we always make sure that there’s someone awake and attentive in the passenger seat to control the air, radio, and to act as another set of eyes paying attention to the road.

   Cognitive distraction while driving is when you take your mind off what you're doing. This type of distraction is still highly debated as some sources state that it doesn’t cause many accidents, while others state that it causes a lot. As suggested in Richard Young’s entry in the *SAE International Journal of Passenger Cars*, a new definition should be created that examines data, defines attention, and studies driving while cognitively distracted and while not [(Young, Cognitive Distractions While Driving, pg. 2)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259598613_Cognitive_Distraction_While_Driving_A_Critical_Review_of_Definitions_and_Prevalence_in_Crashes).

   My family’s plan to combat cognitive distract works hand in hand with our plan for targeting manual and visual distractions. Having someone in the passenger seat (when possible) to speak with others in the car helps to allow the driver to stay focused. In addition to this, my family makes sure to not drive when exhausted, emotional, impaired, or sleepy. If we feel we are not fit to drive in any certain condition, we make sure to ask someone else for a ride or to use a service like Uber. Doing this helps lessen the chance that we drive while cognitively distracted.

   As mentioned earlier, even those that do not operate vehicles should learn about the dangers of distracted driving. In addition, they should be aware of the family’s Distracted Driving Plan to know the do’s and don’ts while in a car. For example, a child may not realize that asking their parents for a snack while driving could pose a danger to everyone in the car and outside of the car. The parent, in a sudden lapse of judgment, may feel that it’s okay to dig through the glove while driving to find a snack for the child. A child knowing what to do and what not to do will be better able to understand that things can wait a few minutes to avoid disastrous situations. 

   Anyone could become a victim of distracted driving at any moment - whether you are physically hurt or emotionally damaged due to someone you know being directly involved. Much research has been done on this topic and more will come in the future. Technological advances are being introduced each year to help combat the rise of technology and things that may pose as distractions. However, it is important to realize that you and your family have the power to control your actions and keep the road safe by making and following a plan. We, as a society, cannot just focus on smart cars and phone apps to make sure we are safe while driving. Ensure that you and everyone around you remains safe, advocate for the importance of creating a distracting Driving Plan, and never let your judgement lapse.
