Welcome to my blog! My name is Princess Dyer and I am a first-year student at Northeastern University. I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio and slowing taking in Boston each day. I am passionate in the field of social sciences and justice and majoring in Criminal Justice and Psychology. I've always loved to read and write, prompting me to plan a minor in English. In my free time, I like to binge on Netflix, play violin, paint, and talk with friends. 

My blog posts will be focusing on my responses to articles and books read as a part of Professor Cordell's Reading and Writing in the Digital Age course. I typically blog every other Saturday or Sunday. I am excited to explore this new form of writing and I hope that you enjoy reading it!
